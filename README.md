This Java program calculates the **sum of all natural numbers from 1 to a user-defined number N** using a simple `for` loop. Itâ€™s a great example for beginners learning loops and user input in Java.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

* Accepts a number `N` from the user.
* Calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to `N`.
* Simple and efficient implementation using a `for` loop.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Prerequisites

* Java installed (JDK 8 or higher)

### Steps

1. Save the code in a file named `sumAll.java`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   javac sumAll.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   java sumAll
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Sample Output

```
Enter a Number: 10
Sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is: 55
```
